# Minimal Rewrite of V-JEPA

Zero Dependency, Zero Config. < 500 LoC

```bash
python model.py
```

Model weights are not included in this repo, but once you run the script it will fetch one from torch hub.

All the credit goes to the original authors of [V-JEPA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/jepa). This is just rewrite.
